# The self Identifier

"""
In Python, the self identifier plays a key role. In the context of the CreditCard
class, there can presumably be many different CreditCard instances, and each must
maintain its own balance, its own credit limit, and so on. Therefore, each instance
stores its own instance variables to reflect its current state.

Syntactically, self identifies the instance upon which a method is invoked. For
example, assume that a user of our class has a variable, my card, that identifies
an instance of the CreditCard class. When the user calls my card.get balance( ),
identifier self, within the definition of the get balance method, refers to the card
known as my card by the caller. The expression, self. balance refers to an instance
variable, named balance, stored as part of that particular credit cardâ€™s state.
